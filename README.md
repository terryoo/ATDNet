# Adaptively Tuning a Convolutional Neural Network by Gate Process for Image Denoising (ACCESS 2019)
Extentition version of Adaptively Tuning a Convolutional Neural Network by Gating Process for Image Denoising (ICIP 2019).
It additionally includes the pixel-wise noise level estimator, therefore it can process spatially variant noisy images.
The network is trained with more sophiscated training skills such as data augmentation and bigger patch size than ICIP 2019.
