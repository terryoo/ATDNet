# Adaptively Tuning a Convolutional Neural Network by Gate Process for Image Denoising (ACCESS 2019)
Extentition version of Adaptively Tuning a Convolutional Neural Network by Gating Process for Image Denoising (ICIP 2019).
It additionally includes the pixel-wise noise level estimator, therefore it can process spatially variant noisy images.
The network is trained with bigger patches than ICIP 2019.
